Web Application -- codebase  -- resides in a Git Repository


        Step 1: Clone the Codebase from the Remote Git Repository to our Local Repository

              ---> Open your command line or terminal.
              ---> Navigate to the directory where we want to clone the project:
                     Ex: cd your-project-folder
              ---> Clone the codebase from the Git repository:
                     Ex: git clone https://github.com/yourcompany/yourproject.git
 
        Step 2: Set Up the Complete Application Using the Codebase


	      ---> Navigate to the backend (Spring Boot) project folder:
		      Ex: cd yourproject/backend
              ---> Build the Spring Boot application using Maven (assuming you have Maven installed):
                      Ex: mvn clean install
              ---> Start the Spring Boot application:
                      Ex: java -jar target/yourproject.jar
              ---> Navigate to the frontend (Angular) project folder:
                      Ex:cd ../frontend
              ---> Install the Angular CLI globally if you haven't already:
                      Ex: npm install -g @angular/cli
              ---> Start the Angular development server:
                      Ex: ng serve


        Step 3: Checking Out the Complete Codebase from the Application's Remote Repository  

              ---> Ensure we're in the project's root directory:
                     cd yourproject(git checkout branch name)
              ---> Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:
                     git pull  


	Step 4: Codebase Available in Local Repo

              ---> At this stage, we have the codebase available in your local repository, 


	Step 5: Set Up Application Components (Microservices, Front End, and Database)





------------------------------------------------â€ƒResponsibility to ask ---------------------------------------------------------------



**1. Functional Workflow of the Project:**

   -- Explanation:* Understanding the functional workflow of the project is crucial for effective development and testing. 
                  * It provides insights into how the application behaves from a user's perspective.
                  * It provides a high-level overview of the features, user journeys, and key processes within the application.

   -- Importance: * Knowing the functional workflow helps developers make informed decisions about code changes and testing scenarios.
                  * A clear understanding of the workflow enables efficient debugging, testing, and feature development.

   -- Example:* If you're working on an e-commerce website, the functional workflow might include:
     		---- User registration and login.
    		---- Browsing products and categories.
     		---- Adding items to the cart.
     		---- Proceeding to checkout and making a purchase.
    		---- Viewing order history.


**2. Repository Details to Checkout Project to the Local:**

   -- Explanation:* Accessing the codebase is fundamental to working on the project.
		  * This involves obtaining the information needed to access the project's codebase from a remote Git repository.
		  * The repository details include the URL of the remote Git repository, which is necessary to clone the project to your local development environment.

   -- Importance:* Access to the codebase is essential for development, collaboration, and version control.
                 * Access to the repository allows you to clone the project's codebase to your local machine and collaborate with team members effectively.

   -- Example:* Repository details might include:
     		---- Git repository URL, e.g., `https://github.com/yourcompany/yourproject.git`.
    		---- To clone the repository locally, you would use the following Git command:
              	        git clone https://github.com/yourcompany/yourproject.git(This command downloads the entire codebase from the remote repository to your local machine, allowing you to work on the project.)
     		---- Credentials, if necessary (username and password or SSH keys).
    		---- Information on the branch to check out (e.g., `main` or `development`).


**3. Design Document Related to the Project:**

   -- Explanation:* Design documents provide an overview of the project's architecture, data structures, and key design decisions.
		  * Design documents provide essential insights into the project's architecture, data models, and system components.
		  * They are valuable references for understanding the underlying structure of the application, including database schemas, API endpoints, and third-party integrations.
		  * Design documents help ensure that your development work aligns with the project's intended architecture and design principles, reducing the risk of architectural issues or misunderstandings.

   -- Importance:* Design documents serve as a reference for understanding the system's structure and making informed development choices.

   -- Example:* Design documents may include:
       		---- Architectural Diagrams: Visual representations of the system's components and their interactions.
		---- Database Schema: Details about the structure of the database, including tables, relationships, and data types.
    		---- Data flow diagrams.
     		---- Technology stack and design patterns used.
		---- API Documentation:Information about API endpoints, request methods, and expected responses.
		---- User Interface (UI) Wireframes: Sketches or mockups illustrating the application's user interface.
